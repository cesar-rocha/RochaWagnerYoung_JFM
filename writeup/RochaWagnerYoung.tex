\section{Introduction}

% 1) The mesoscale energy conundrum: a recalcitrant problem
Geostrophic turbulence, a main paradigm of ocean mesoscale flows,
transfers energy towards large scales. The energy flux out of the mesoscales
en route to viscous dissipation, therefore, must involve
ageostrophic dynamics.
Indeed, existing studies advance a panoply of mechanisms to account for the required
forward flow of energy.
These include, but are not limited to, surface and
benthic boundary turbulence and internal-wave generation by mesoscale eddies
negotiating
bottom topography \citep[see ][their figure 1, and references therein]{nagai_etal2015}.
But roughly half of the energy flux out of the mesoscales remains unaccounted for
\citep{ferrari_wunsch2009,nagai_etal2015}.

% 2) stimulated generation: a newish mechanism
Recent research has suggested that the interaction
of geostrophic flows with existing internal waves serves
as a major sink of mesoscale energy en route to viscous dissipation
\citep{xie_vanneste2015,taylor_straub2016,wagner_young2016,barkan_etal2016,shakespeare_hogg2017}.
The emphasis on the energy extraction by \textit{existing} internal waves---here
denoted stimulated generation---
contrasts with energy loss via spontaneous emission---a process
by which internal waves are emitted during geostrophic adjustment.
While spontaneous emission is localized
at sharp fronts (large Rossby number, $\Ro\gtrsim 1$) in the surface boundary
layer \citep[e.g., ][]{shakespeare_hogg2017}, stimulated generation operates at
the small Rossby number ($\Ro\ll 1$), quasi-geostrophic regime, both in the upper
ocean and in the interior \citep[e.g., ][]{xie_vanneste2015}.

% \footnote{Following \cite{xie_vanneste2015} and
% \cite{wagner_young2016}, we define
% \textit{stimulated generation} as wave-mean interactions that transfer energy from
% geostrophic motions (the mean flow) to \textit{existing} internal
% waves. This definition contrasts with the nomenclature employed by
% \cite{barkan_etal2016}, who term stimulated generation a process by which
% internal waves trigger a forward cascade from mesoscale to submesoscale subinertial flows.}

% 3) A minimal model of stimulated generation
To illuminate the physical mechanisms of energy extraction from
barotropic flow by existing internal waves, we analyze a
simple model of stimulated generation. This minimal model is a special
family of solutions of the \cite{xie_vanneste2015} equations, which couple the
evolution of near-inertial waves (NIWs) with quasi-geostrophic (QG) flow. The
focus on this specific class of wave-mean interactions is justified:  geostrophic
eddies account for the bulk of the oceanic eddy kinetic energy
\cite[$90\%$,][]{ferrari_wunsch2009} and near-inertial waves contain most of the
oceanic high-frequency variability \citep{alford_etal2016}.

The main analytical result of this paper, an overlooked equation for the wave potential
energy \eqref{Pw}, clarifies the physics of quasi-inviscid stimulated generation
associated with vertical vorticity and lateral strain. The convergence of wave
kinetic energy into anti-cyclones and the geostrophic straining of the wave field
represent sources of wave potential energy---and sinks of geostrophic kinetic energy.
Numerical solutions of
initial-value problems confirm our interpretation of \eqref{Pw}. And the solution
diagnostics reveal that geostrophic straining is the main source of wave potential
energy---and sink of geostrophic kinetic energy. In this quasi-inviscid limit,
wave dispersion is the only mechanism that stops the energy conversion by moving
the waves out of the straining regions.

\section{The \cite{xie_vanneste2015} minimal QG-NIW model}
The \cite{xie_vanneste2015} minimal model (Appendix A) assumes
barotropic balanced flow, $\psi=\psi(x,y,t)$,
uniform background buoyancy frequency, $N_0$, $\beta=0$, and a single propagating
wave mode in the vertical, $\ee^{\ii m z}$, so that the dynamical fields are:
\begin{align}
\label{horizontal_velocity}
\text{Horizontal velocity:}&\qquad u + \ii v  = \ee^{\ii (m z - f_0 t)}\,\phi -(\p_y-\ii\p_x)\psi\,;\\
  \label{vertical_velocity}
\text{Vertical velocity:}&\qquad  w = \tfrac{1}{2 m} (\p_y-\ii\p_x)\ee^{\ii (m z - f_0 t)}\phi  + \text{cc}  \,;\\
\label{pressure}
\text{Pressure:}&\qquad p = \half f_0\lambda^2 (\p_y-\ii\p_x)\ee^{\ii (m z - f_0 t)}\phi
+\text{cc} + f_0 \psi \,;\\
\label{buoyancy}
\text{Buoyancy:}&\qquad b =  \tfrac{m}{2} f_0\lambda^2 (\p_x+\ii\p_y)\ee^{\ii (m z - f_0 t)}\phi + \text{cc}
  \per
\end{align}
Above $\lambda = \tfrac{N_0}{f_0\, m}$ is an intrinsic horizontal scale and cc denotes
complex conjugate. And $\phi = \phi(x,y,t)$ is a complex near-inertial back-rotated velocity,
which determines all wave fields in \eqref{horizontal_velocity}--\eqref{buoyancy}.
In other words, with $\psi=0$, \eqref{horizontal_velocity}--\eqref{buoyancy}
are wave polarization relations.

The balanced flow,
whose streamfunction $\psi$ determines all balanced fields in
\eqref{horizontal_velocity}--\eqref{buoyancy}, satisfies the
wave-averaged inversion relationship
\citep[cf. ][]{wagner_young2015}:
\beq
\label{qgpv}
q = \lap \psi +
                 \tfrac{1}{f_0}\Big[ \tfrac{1}{4} \lap |\phi|^2 + \tfrac{\ii}{2}
                 \sJ(\phi^\star,\phi)\Big]\com
\eeq
where $\lap \defn \p_x^2 + \p_y^2$ is the horizontal
Laplacian and $\sJ(f,g)=f_x g_y - f_y g_x$ is the lateral Jacobian, and
the superscript star $^\star$ denotes complex conjugation.

The balanced flow follows quasi-geostrophic potential-vorticity dynamics,
\beq
\label{macroturb}
q_t + \sJ(\psi,q) = D_q\com
\eeq
and the wave velocity satisfies
\beq
\label{waves}
\phi_t + \sJ(\psi,\phi) + \tfrac{\ii}{2}\phi\lap \psi - \tfrac{\ii}{2} f_0 \lambda^2 \lap \phi
 = D_\phi\com
\eeq
where   is an intrinsic horizontal scale.

The wave model is similar to the \cite{young_benjelloul1997} equation.
The back-rotated wave velocity
evolves through dispersion---the last term in \eqref{waves}---and
advection and refraction by the geostrophic flow---the second and third terms in
\eqref{waves}. But the wave equation \eqref{waves} is non-linear owing to the
quadratic wave terms in the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity \eqref{qgpv}. In other
words, the
\cite{young_benjelloul1997} near-inertial model is purely kinematic: the geostrophic
flow evolves as if there were no waves and sets an
inhomogeneous medium in which the waves propagate.
But the \cite{xie_vanneste2015} model is dynamic because both $q$ and $\phi$
determine the flow: $\psi=\psi(x,y,t; q, \phi)$. Besides advection and refraction of waves
by the geostrophic flow, these wave-mean interactions in \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves}
imply a positive finite-amplitude wave frequency shift (Appendix A).

The wave equation \eqref{waves} resembles the reduced-gravity
Young \& Ben Jelloul model derived by  \cite{danioux_etal2015}. Without advection,
\eqref{waves} is analogous to Schrodinger's equation
\citep[e.g.,][ pg. 51]{landau_lifshitz2013}, with the relative vorticity, $\lap\psi$,
playing the role of the
potential, and the dispersivity, $f_0\lambda^2$, as Planck's constant
\citep{danioux_etal2015}.

The terms on the right of
\eqref{macroturb}  and \eqref{waves}, $D_q$ and $D_\phi$, represent small-scale dissipation. The
introduction of these terms is \textit{ad hoc}, likely breaking the asymptotic ordering of the \cite{xie_vanneste2015}
model. But small-scale dissipation is necessary to absorb the forward transfers
of potential enstrophy and wave kinetic and potential energies in the numerical
simulations reported below.
We find that biharmonic diffusion, e.g.,
\beq
D_q = -\kappa_e \lap^2 q\com
\eeq
is sufficient to extend the spectral resolution compared to Laplacian diffusion, while avoiding
obscure physical effects of higher-order diffusion or spectral
filter.
In practice, we choose the diffusivity that places the 35$\%$ highest
modes in the dissipation range, so that aliased wavenumbers are strongly damped.

\subsection{The WKB limit}
An important feature of the wave equation \eqref{waves} is that no horizontal scale
separation of scales between waves and balanced flow is assumed. In other words,
the wave equation \eqref{waves} isn't host to the WKB approximation
\citep[e.g., ][]{young_benjelloul1997}. But the WKB limit can be easily recovered.
In this limit, plane-wave solutions, $\phi \sim \ee^{\kb \cdot \xb -  \omg t}$,
yield the dispersion relationship
\beq\label{disp1}
\tfrac{\omg}{f_0} = \half \lambda^2 |\kb|^2 + \tfrac{1}{f_0}\zhb\cdot(\kb\times\grad\psi)
 + \tfrac{1}{2f_0}\lap\psi\com
\eeq
where $\omega = f_0 + \omg$ is the wave frequency, $\kb = (k,l)$ is the horizontal
wavevector, and $\zhb$ is the vertical unit vector. The first term on the right
of \eqref{disp1} is a linear approximation to the fractional change of the wave
frequency about $f_0$. The second term represents Doppler shift by large-scale
geostrophic advection. And the last term is a frequency shift due to geostrophic
vorticity \citep{kunze1985,young_benjelloul1997}.


\subsection{Wave self-interaction and frequency shift}
The the wave equation \eqref{waves} is non-linear because both $q$ and $\phi$
determine the flow $\psi$, which advects and refracts $\phi$. The wave contribution
to $\psi$ is quadratic in $\phi$ (cf. \eqref{qgpv}). Thus, the non-linear wave
dynamics in   \eqref{waves} is cubic in $\phi$.
To study these non-linear wave effects, we linearize the QG-NIW equations  about
 the exact solution
$\phi = U_w = \text{real constant}$ and $\psi = 0$, so that $q=0$. (Reality of
$\Phi$ is assumed for algebraic simplicity below. But the final result is
essentially unchanged
with complex $\Phi = U_w + \ii V_w$---$U_w^2$ is changed to $|\Phi|^2$.) The potential-vorticity
equation \eqref{macroturb} linearized about this state is trivial: $q_t = 0$,
 thus $q$ remains zero. Also,
\beq
\label{lin_q}
 \lap \psi = -\tfrac{U_w}{2f_0}\lap\half(\phi + \phis)\com
\eeq
where $\phi$ represents the small departure about $U_w$, so that
the linearized wave equation becomes
\beq
\phi_t = \tfrac{\ii}{2}\left[\tfrac{U_w^2}{2f_0}\lap\half(\phi+\phis) +
f_0\lambda^2\lap\phi\right] \per
\eeq
Recalling that the wave velocity is $u_w + \ii v_w = \ee^{\ii (mz -f_0 t)}\phi(x,y,t)$,
the wave equation is recast:
\beq
\left[\p_t^2 - \tfrac{1}{4}f_0\lambda^2\left(f_0\lambda^2+
\frac{U_w^2}{2f_0}\right)\lap^2\right] v_w = 0\com
\eeq
where $\lap^2 = (\p_x^2 + \p_y^2)^2$. Plane-wave solutions yield the
dispersion relation
\beq
\tfrac{\omg}{f_0} = \half \lambda^2|\kb|^2\left[1+\half\tfrac{U_w^2}{f_0^2\lambda^2}
\right]^{1/2}\com
\eeq
and we conclude that the wave self-interaction shifts the frequency by
\beq
\left[1+\half\tfrac{U_w^2}{f_0^2\lambda^2}\right]^{1/2}-1\per
\eeq
The frequency shift is positive definite and depends on the square of the ratio
of the radius of the inertial circle $U_w/f_0$ to the intrinsic scale $\lambda$.
If that
ratio is small, then the frequency shift is  $\approx  U_w^2/(4 f_0^2\lambda^2)$.

\section{The physics of stimulated generation}

\subsection{Power integrals and energy conversion}
From \eqref{waves}, we deduce that the near-inertial kinetic energy density $\half |\phi|^2$
satisfies
\beq
\label{action_density}
\p_t \half |\phi|^2 + \sJ(\psi,\half|\phi|^2) + \diver\underbrace{\left[\tfrac{\ii}{4}
f_0\lambda^2\left(
\phi\grad\phis-\phis\grad\phi\right)\right]}_{\defn \Ff_w} = \half(\phis D_\phi + \phi D_{\phis})
\per
\eeq
Locally, $\half |\phi|^2$ changes due to divergences of the geostrophic
and wave fluxes and dissipation---the second, third, and fourth terms in
\eqref{action_density}. The wave flux  $\Ff_w$ is analogous to the probability
current density of quantum mechanics \citep[e.g., ][pg. 57]{landau_lifshitz2013}.
 Using the polar representation
$\phi = |\phi|\ee^{\ii\Theta}$ \citep[e.g., ][]{klein_etal2004}, we can
unpack the wave flux:
\beq
\label{Fw2}
\Ff_w =\tfrac{\ii}{4}f_0\lambda^2\left(\phi\grad\phis-\phis\grad\phi\right) =
f_0 \lambda^2\grad\Theta \times
\half |\phi|^2\com
\eeq
where $f_0\lambda^2\grad\Theta
= \tfrac{N^2_0}{f_0 m^2}\grad\Theta$ is the generalized group
velocity of hydrostatic near-inertial waves, which can be quickly verified under
the plane-wave assumption, $\Theta = kx + ly$.

With simple boundary conditions, e.g., periodic or no normal flux, the
wave kinetic energy budget is
\beq
\label{action}
\frac{\dd}{\dd t} \underbrace{\half \la |\phi|^2 \ra}_{\defn K_w} =
\varepsilon_\phi \com
\eeq
where angle brackets, $\la \,\,\ra$, represent average over the domain of area
$\mathcal{A}$:
\beq
\label{average}
\la\, f \ra \defn \frac{1}{\mathcal{A}}\iint\limits_{\mathcal{A}} f \,\dd x \dd y\per
\eeq
Also in \eqref{action}, $\varepsilon_\phi$ is the rate of dissipation of wave kinetic energy
(see appendix B for an explicit expression). In the inviscid limit, $\varepsilon_\phi\to 0$, the coupled model
\eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves} conserves wave kinetic energy, $K_w$
\citep{xie_vanneste2015}.

Also from \eqref{waves}, we derive an equation for the wave potential energy
$P_w \defn \half \la b^2 \ra/N_0^2 = \tfrac{\lambda^2}{4}\la|\grad\phi|^2\ra$:
$\tfrac{\lambda^2}{4}\la\lap\phis\times\eqref{waves}$ + $\lap\phi\times
\eqref{waves}^\star\ra$ yields
\begin{align}
\label{Pw}
\dot P_w =
& \underbrace{\tfrac{1}{f_0}\Big\la\half\lap\psi\diver\Ff_w
\Big\ra}_{\defn\Gamma_{r}} +
\underbrace{\tfrac{\lambda^2}{2}\, \Big\la\half\psi\left[\sJ(\phi,\lap\phis)
+ \sJ(\phis,\lap\phi)\right]\Big\ra}_{\defn\Gamma_a}
\, +\,\, \chi_\phi \com
\end{align}
where $\chi_\phi$ is the dissipation of wave potential energy (see appendix B
for explicit expressions).

And from \eqref{macroturb}, we form an equation for the geostrophic kinetic energy
$K_e\defn \half \la|\grad\psi|^2\ra$: $-\la\psi\times\eqref{macroturb}\ra$, with \eqref{qgpv}, \eqref{action_density},
\eqref{waves}, and multiple integration by parts, give
\beq
\label{Ke}
\dot K_e =
 - (\Gamma_r + \Gamma_a) + \Xi +  \varepsilon_q \com
\eeq
where $\Xi$ is a source of geostrophic kinetic energy due to
wave dissipation and $\varepsilon_q$ is the rate of dissipation of geostrophic
kinetic energy (see appendix B for explicit expressions).

In the inviscid limit, $\chi_\phi\to 0$ and $\Xi\to 0$ and $\varepsilon_q \to 0$,
the coupled model \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves} conserves the energy \citep{xie_vanneste2015}
\beq
\label{E}
E \defn K_e + P_w\per
\eeq
In \eqref{Ke},
$\Gamma_r + \Gamma_a$ is the conversion between geostrophic kinetic energy and
wave potential energy.
The term $\Gamma_r$   stems from refraction and is easy to
interpret: the convergence, $\nabla\cdot\Ff_w < 0$, of the wave flux of kinetic energy density
 into anticyclones, $\lap\psi<0$, is a source of wave potential
energy, $P_w$. The term $\Gamma_a$ stems from advection and resembles the source
of variance of a passive scalar (tracer) gradient subject to lateral advection
\beq
\label{c_t}
c_t + \sJ(\psi,c) = 0.
\eeq
From \eqref{c_t}, we deduce that $\la\lap c \sJ(\psi,c)\ra$ is the
 production of tracer-gradient variance, $\la |\grad c|^2\ra$.
Analogously, $\Gamma_a$ is the source of wave potential energy due to geostrophic
stirring.  After multiple
integration by parts, we rewrite this term as
\beq
\label{gradphi}
  \Gamma_a =
    \left\la
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \phi_x^\star & \phi_y^\star
    \end{bmatrix}
    \Sf
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \phi_x \\  \phi_y
    \end{bmatrix}\right\ra\com
\eeq
where $\Sf$ is the symmetric part of the geostrophic velocity gradient matrix,
\beq
\Sf \defn
\begin{bmatrix}
    -\psi_{xy} & \half(\psi_{xx} - \psi_{yy})\\
    \half(\psi_{xx}-\psi_{yy}) & \psi_{xy}
\end{bmatrix}\,\com
\eeq
whose sum of the elements squared (the Frobenius norm) is the variance of
the geostrophic rate of strain. Hence, geostrophic straining enhances gradients
of $\phi$, thereby generating wave potential energy, $P_w$. When the geostrophic flow has
a lateral scale much larger than
the waves, this distortion of $\phi$ is akin to the wave capture
mechanism of \cite{buhler_mcintyre2005}.

The standard \cite{young_benjelloul1997} equation with barotropic geostrophic flow
and single-model near-inertial vertical structure
also satisfies the potential energy equation \eqref{Pw}. But
\cite{young_benjelloul1997} and subsequent studies overlooked the wave potential
energy power integral, \eqref{Pw}, or its generalization to baroclinic quasi-geostrophic flow.
Of course, the standard Young
\& Ben Jelloul wave equation is uncoupled from the quasi-geostrophic potential
vorticity equation, hence an increase in wave potential energy is not matched by a
decrease in geostrophic kinetic energy.

\subsection{Averaged equations and loss of coherence}
The spatially-averaged (coherent) wave amplitude satisfies
\beq
\label{phi_ave}
\frac{\dd}{\dd t}\la \phi \ra + \ii \left\la\half\phi\lap\psi \right\ra =
D_{\la\phi\ra}\per
\eeq
Introducing the decomposition $\phi = \la\phi\ra+\phi'$, we have
\beq
\half\la|\phi|^2\ra
= \underbrace{\half|\la\phi\ra|^2}_{\defn K^c_w} +
\underbrace{\half\la|\phi'|^2\ra}_{\defn K^i_w}\com
\eeq
Thus, the kinetic energy of horizontally incoherent, $\phi'$, and coherent,
 $\la\phi\ra$, waves satisfy
\beq
\label{Kiw}
\dot{K}_w^i = \Pi + \varepsilon_{\la\phi\ra}\com
\eeq
and
\beq
\label{Kcw}
\dot{K}_w^c = -\Pi + \varepsilon_{\phi'}\com
\eeq
with the kinetic energy transfer
\beq
\label{Pi}
\Pi = \tfrac{\ii}{2}\left[\la\half\phi\lap\psi\ra\la\phis\ra -
\la\half\phis\lap\psi\ra\la\phi\ra\right]\com
\eeq
which measures the loss of lateral coherence of the wave field. Also in \eqref{Kiw}
and \eqref{Kcw}, $\varepsilon_{\la\phi\ra}$ and $\varepsilon_{\phi'}$ are the dissipation
of kinetic energy of incoherent and coherent waves, respectively.

\subsection{Relevant parameters}
Consider the scaling
\beq\label{scaling}
\psi \sim U_e k_e^{-1} \com\qquad \text{and} \qquad \phi \sim U_w\com
\eeq
with characteristic QG and NIW velocity scales $U_e$ and $U_w$, and the
characteristic horizontal length scale $k_e^{-1}$ and time scale $(U_e k_e)^{-1}$.
Using \eqref{scaling} in \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves}
reveals that there are two dynamically relevant parameters of the QG-NIW problem
described by \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves}. First, the `wave amplitude'
\beq
\label{alpha}
\alpha \defn \underbrace{\frac{U_e k_e}{f_0}}_{\defn Ro} \times
{\left(\frac{U_w}{U_e}\right)^2}\com
\eeq
measures the strength of the waves compared to the geostrophic flow and scales
the contribution of the wave terms in the potential vorticity \eqref{qgpv}.
Second, the `wave dispersivity,'
\beq
\label{hslash}
\hslash \defn f_0 \lambda^2 \times \frac{k_e}{U_e}\com
\eeq
scales the importance of linear dispersion, which extenuates the unsmoothing
effects of advection and refraction.

\subsection{Summary}
The following initial value problem that idealizes the oceanographic post-storm scenario
illuminates the physics of stimulated generation. Stormy winds impart momentum
into the ocean, thereby generating near-inertial oscillations with a lateral
decorrelation scale larger than the mesoscale eddies. The coupled model
\eqref{macroturb}--\eqref{waves} describes the post-storm evolution
of this initially coherent inertial oscillation
 \citep{xie_vanneste2015,wagner_young2016}. Geostrophic refraction
concentrates the waves in anticyclones. The eddy-scale gradients of $\phi$ then support
geostrophic advection. Advection and refraction reduce the lateral coherence
of the waves---and wave dispersion counteracts this unsmoothing effect.

The explicit expression for energy
conversion on the right of \eqref{Pw} clarifies the mechanisms of wave-mean energy
exchange. First, refraction causes a convergence of wave kinetic energy density in
anticyclones. Then, advection strains the wave field, enhancing the gradients of
wave velocity created by refraction. Both
processes generate wave potential energy at the expenses of geostrophic kinetic
energy, thus motivating the nomenclature `refraction sink' ($-\Gamma_r$) and
`advection sink' ($-\Gamma_a$)  of geostrophic kinetic energy.

The remaining of this paper verifies this thought experiment and quantifies the
energy conversion by solving
numerically two problems in which an initially perfectly coherent near-inertial
oscillation interacts with the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole (Section 3) and with a turbulent
field emergent from random initial conditions (Section 4).

\section{An idealized solution: the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole}
As a preamble to our discussion of the QG-NIW energy transfers in freely-evolving
turbulence, we consider a simpler example in which the initial quasi-geostrophic flow
is given the the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole. This dipole is an exact solution of the Euler
equations on an infinite two-dimensional plane where the vorticity is confined
to a circle of radius $R$ \cite[][]{meleshko_vanheijst1994}. The solution, steady on
a frame moving at uniform zonal velocity $U_e$, is
\beq
\label{lambd_q}
  \lap\psi =
     \frac{2 U_e \kappa}{J_0(\kappa R)} \begin{cases}
      J_1(\kappa r)\sin\theta\com & \text{if}
      \qquad r\le R\com\\
      0\com &\text{if} \qquad r\ge R\com
  \end{cases}
\eeq
where $r^2 = (x-x_c)^2+(y-y_c)^2$ is the radial distance about the dipole's center
$(x_c,y_c)$, $\tan \theta = (y-y_c)/(x-x_c)$, and $J_n$ is the n'th order Bessel
function of first kind. The matching condition at $r=R$, $J_1(\kappa R)=0$, determines
$\kappa$. The dipole is the first eigensolution, with eigenvalue $\kappa R \approx
3.8287$.  If the wave potential vorticity is zero, then the dipole \eqref{lambd_q} is a
solution of \eqref{macroturb}. This is the case when a uniform $\phi$ is used as
initial condition (Sections 3 and 4).

The initial wave velocity is given by a uniform (i.e.,
perfectly  coherent) near-inertial oscillation with speed $U_w$:
\beq
\label{NIO}
\phi(x,y,t=0) = \tfrac{1 + \ii}{\sqrt{2}}\, U_w\per
\eeq

\subsection{Parameters inspired by the Ocean Storms Experiment}
 Inspired by
the Ocean Storms Experiments \citep{dasaro1995}, we choose $U_e =
5\times 10^{-2}$ m s$^{-1}$, $R = 2\pi/k_e = 84$ km, and $f_0= 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$
($\sim 45^\circ$N), which gives $\Ro \approx 3.75\times 10^{-2}$. Strong storm
over weak mesoscale flow generates strong near-inertial currents \citep{dasaro1995}.
Choosing $U_w = 10\times U_e = 10^{-1}$m s$^{-1}$ yields a wave amplitude
$\alpha\approx 3.75$. A NIW with a typical vertical wavelength, $2\pi/m = 325$ m,
and $N_0= 50 \times f_0 = 5\times 10^{-3}$
s$^{-1}$, yields a moderate dispersivity  $\hslash \approx 1$.

\subsection{Solution for $\hslash \approx 1$ and $\alpha \approx 3.75$}
We solve the coupled model \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves} subject to the
initial conditions \eqref{lambd_q} and \eqref{NIO} and the parameters inspired
by the Ocean Storms Experiment. We integrate the solutions numerically
 for $30$ eddy-turnover time units,
$30\times (U_e k_e)^{-1}\approx 90$ days, on a
doubly periodic domain using standard Fourier pseudo-spectral methods (detail in appendix B).
Dipole images, artifacts of periodization,
cause a small zonal drift of the dipole. To render this drift negligible, we
choose a domain size much larger than the dipole's radius, $R/L \approx 0.06$.
Table B.1 provides a full description of solution parameters.

Because the initial wave velocity is laterally uniform, refraction dominates
the initial evolution of the solution.
Indeed, the solution presents a dramatic wave concentration
in the anticyclone and wave expulsion from the cyclone in the first couple of
eddy turnover time units, $(U_e k_e)^{-1}$. After $5 \times (U_e k_e)^{-1}$, there
is a threefold modulation of the wave kinetic energy density on eddy scales
(Figure \ref{snaps_lamb}). The  correlation coefficient
\beq
\label{corr_r}
r \defn \frac{\left\la |\phi'|^2\,\lap\psi\right\ra}{
\left\la |\phi'|^4\right\ra^{1/2} \left\la (\lap \psi)^2\right\ra^{1/2}}\com
\eeq
quantifies the wave concentration in regions positive or negative vorticity;
negative correlation, $r<0$, indicates wave concentration in anticyclones
\citep{danioux_etal2015}. Starting form the uniform wave initial condition,
vorticity and incoherent wave kinetic energy density
quickly become negatively correlated ($r=-0.75$ at $t\times U_e k_e$ = 2;
Figure \ref{stats_lamb}d). This initial wave focusing in anticyclones is associated
with a rapid increase in incoherent wave kinetic energy (Figure \ref{stats_lamb}c)
and a rapid increase of wave potential energy (Figure \ref{stats_lamb}b). The gain of
wave potential energy, ininitially dominated by the conversion due to refraction,
$\Gamma_r$,
 occurs at the expenses of geostrophic kinetic energy
(Figure \ref{stats_lamb}a):
the dipole's kinetic energy decays by about 20$\%$ in two eddy-turnover time units.
The strong wave concentration in the negative vorticity region, and the accompanying
geostrophic energy loss, weakens the anticyclone.  This asymmetry in wave concentration
tilts the dipole and the vortex self-induced zonal velocity no longer matches the
downstream uniform flow: the dipole starts to drift upstream at $t\times U_e
k_e \approx 5$.

% Now comment on the advection conversion (and wave dispersion)...
The eddy-scale gradients in wave velocity, which are created by refraction,
 allow for the other mechanisms in the wave equation \eqref{waves} to become
 important. Linear dispersion radiates waves from the dipole, with horizontal
scales comparable to $k_e^{-1}$. And geostrophic advection starts to enhance
 the refraction-created gradients. As a consequence of these two processes becoming
 important, the correlation $r$ decreases.

The advective conversion, $\Gamma_a$, kicks
off at $t\times U_e k_e \approx 4$ (Figure \ref{stats_lamb}b), and takes over
the $\Gamma$ in few eddy-turnover time units. Contemporarily, the wave-induced
quasi-geostrophic flow strains the anticyclone, which develops a filamentary structure.
Because most of the advective energy conversion occurs in the anticyclone, the
negative correlation $r$ decreases further, and becomes positive at
$t\times U_e k_e \approx 7$. At this point, $\Gamma_r$ becomes weakly negative
(i.e., from waves to geostrophic flow), though the total conversion, $\Gamma_r
+ \Gamma_a$, remains positive thanks to a strong positive advective conversion.
The energy conversion nearly halts at $t\times U_e k_e \approx 20$.

Because the advective conversion, $\Gamma_a$, remains positive for the duration
of the simulation, $\Gamma_a$ accounts for the bulk conversion of energy from
geostrophic flow to waves. Indeed, the time-integrated $\Gamma_a$ accounts for $77.5\%$
of total geostrophic kinetic energy change (Table \ref{table1}); the time-integrated
refraction conversion, $\Gamma_r$, represents $22.7\%$ of the geostrophic kinetic
energy changes. And direct dissipation and wave-dissipation source
(Appendix B) account for the residual changes ($<1\%$).

\section{Macroturbulence solutions: decaying barotropic flow}

To study the energy exchange between near-inertial waves and quasi-geostrophic flow
in a turbulent regime relevant to the ocean, we consider a barotropic flow that emerges from
random initial conditions integrated for 20 eddy turnover time units.
In other words, we first integrate the initial condition
\beq
\label{psi_init}
\psi \big(x,y, t \times U_e k_e = -20\big) = \sum_{k,l} |\hat{\psi}|\cos\left(k x + l y +
\chi_{k,l}\right)
\eeq
with waveless QG dynamics before introducing waves at $t\times U_e k_e = 0$.
In \ref{psi_init}, $\chi_{k,l}$ is a random phase uniformly distributed on $[0, 2\pi)$,
 and $|\hat\psi|$ is the streamfunction isotropic spectrum
\beq
\label{psih_mag}
|\hat{\psi}| = C \times \big\{|k|\,[1 + (|k|/k_e)^4]\big\}^{-1/2}\com
\eeq
with the wavenumber magnitude $|k|^2 = k^2 + l^2$. The prescribed initial energy
$U_e^2/2$ determines the constant C:
\beq
\label{ke_init}
\sum_{k,l} \underbrace{|k|^2 |\hat{\psi}|^2}_{\defn \cK_e} = \tfrac{1}{2}U_e^2\per
\eeq
The kinetic energy spectrum, $\cK_e$, peaks at the energy-containing scale $k_e^{-1}$.
At scales larger than $k_e^{-1}$, $\cK_e$ has a linear dependence on $|k|$,
whereas $\cK_e$ decays as $|k|^{-3}$ at scales smaller than $k_e^{-1}$. This red spectrum
ensures insignificant energy dissipation by the biharmonic diffusivity in \eqref{macroturb}.

 The evolution of a random initial condition constrained by the quasi-inviscid
 quasi-geostrophic dynamics \eqref{macroturb} has been well studied, beginning
with \cite{fornberg1977}.
 Stirring of vorticity, $\lap \psi$, by the flow, $\psi$, transfers enstrophy towards
 small scales; energy flows to large
 scales. Most of enstrophy is dissipated within few eddy turnover time units, whereas
 kinetic energy is nearly conserved. Vorticity concentrates into localized
 structures: after 20 eddy turnover time units, the vorticity is well-organized
 into a sea of coherent vortices that form via like-sign vortex merging
 \citep[e.g., ][]{mcwilliams1984}.

 We add a perfectly coherent near-inertial oscillation \eqref{NIO} to the mature
 barotropic turbulence at $t \times U_e k_e = 0$. For all parameters considered
 in the remaining of this paper, there are no qualitative long-term differences
 between the solutions described below and results from introducing the waves
 at $t\times U_e k_e = -20$.

\subsection{Parameters for strong mid-latitude macroturbulence}

Consider strong mid-latitude macroturbulence, such as the Gulf Stream or Kuroshio
Extension. The choice of parameters, $U_e = 0.1$ m s$^{-1}$,
$f_0 = 1 \times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$, $2\pi k_e^{-1} = 125$ km
gives a Rossby number $Ro \approx  0.05$. For reference, the eddy-turnover scale
is $(U_e k_e)^{-1}\approx 5.8\,\,\text{days}$. Strong near-inertial velocity
imparted by atmospheric storms, $U_w \sim \sqrt{2} U_e$, implies a wave amplitude
\beq
  \alpha \approx 0.1\per
\eeq
A near-inertial vertical wavelength of $\lambda_z = 2\pi/m = 300$ m \citep[e.g., ][]{alford_etal2016}
on a strongly stratified upper ocean, $N_0/f_0 = 100$, yields a dispersivity
\beq
  \hslash \approx 1.0 \per
\eeq

\subsection{Solutions for $\hslash = 1$ and $\alpha = 0.1$}

The decaying turbulence experiment with $\hslash = 1$ and $\alpha = 0.1$
qualitatively resembles the Lamb-Chaplygin solution.
Starting from a uniform wave field, refraction quickly concentrates the waves into
anticyclones. By
$t\times U_e k_e \approx 2$ there is a four-fold modulation of the wave kinetic
energy density on eddy scales (Figure \ref{snaps_turb}), reducing the lateral
coherence of the waves (Figure \ref{stats_turb}c). This initial wave concentration
into anticyclones is dramatic, $r < -0.75$, thereby causing a rapid wave potential
energy gain at the expenses of geostrophic kinetic energy loss
(Figure \ref{stats_turb}a).

The eddy-scale gradients of wave velocity support geostrophic advection and
wave dispersion. Indeed, the advective conversion, $\Gamma_a$, quicks off once
refraction imprints eddy scales on the wave field. Both advection and wave dispersion
reduce the wave concentration in anticyclones, and the refraction conversion,
$\Gamma_r$, decreases dramatically, reducing by half  at $t\times U_e k_e \approx 3$.
(Figure \ref{stats_turb}d). At this point, the $\Gamma_a$ takes over the total energy conversion.
At later time, $t\times U_e k_e > 5$, the refraction conversion is small
in amplitude and oscillates about zero (Figure \ref{stats_turb}b).
But the large $\Gamma_a$ sustains the positive total energy conversion. The long-term
wave field has scales smaller than the eddies and no wave concentration into anticyclones
(Figure \ref{snaps_turb}).

Wave potential energy accounts for about $18\%$ of the bulk changes of geostrophic
kinetic energy (Table \ref{table2}). Advective conversion accounts for most of the
energy change, representing about 98$\%$ of the bulk energy conversion. Direct
dissipation accounts for about $6\%$ of the loss of geostrophic kinetic energy.
And the wave-dissipation source is significant: $\Xi_r$ contributes about $7\%$
of geostrophic kinetic energy gain.

Besides the energy extraction from the decaying turbulence flow, the waves
also cause larger direct dissipation of geostrophic kinetic energy compared with
a waveless QG solution with the same parameters (Appendix B). In the waveless solution
the dissipation, $\varepsilon_\psi$, is about $2\%$, most of which occurs at
$t\times U_e k_e < 20$. The direct dissipation of geostrophic kinetic energy is
a consequence of the small-scale diffusion introduced in the potential vorticity equation
\eqref{macroturb}. Hence, the stronger
dissipation in the coupled model is due to finer scaler developed in the relative
and potential
vorticities, $\lap\psi$ and $q$. Indeed,
$\lap\psi$ has more texture than than waveless vorticity
(compare figure \ref{pv-terms_turb} with figure C1),
particularly outside the core of the vortices (Figure \eqref{pv-terms_turb}b).
The wave terms of the potential vorticity  are dominated by small scales and
smaller than $\lap\psi$ (Figure \eqref{pv-terms_turb}c-d). Interestingly, much
of the roughness in $\lap\psi$ is canceled by the small-scale structures in the
wave potential vorticity, yielding a
smoother---but rougher than waveless QG---potential vorticity
 (compare figures \ref{snaps_turb} with figure C2).

\subsection{Varying dispersivity}
Figure \ref{stats_turb_various}
summarizes results from a set of solutions with varying the vertical wavelength
$2\pi\,m^{-1}$ from 200 to 800 m, yielding dispersivities ranging from 0.25 to 4.
(All other parameters are fixed.)
The initial conversion due to refraction, $\Gamma_r(t \times U_e k_e < 20)$,
increases slowly with $\hslash$ (Figure \ref{stats_turb_various}c). The advective
conversion, $\Gamma_a$, dominates the total conversion in all solutions. This term
is largest for the weakest dispersivity regime and
decays approximately exponentially with increasing dispersivity. Indeed, the initial
wave potential energy growth sharpens with decreasing dispersivity.
For the smallest dispersivity considered here, $\hslash = 0.25$,
the wave potential energy peaks at $t\times U_e k_e\approx 25$, and then decays
(see blue curve in figure \ref{stats_turb_various}a).
This due to strong dissipation of wave potential energy because weak dispersion is
ineffective in extenuating the generation of small scales by advection;
 the small scales created by geostrophic advection also implies strong direct
dissipation of geostrophic kinetic energy. In other words, the quasi-inviscid
weak-dispersion limit is inaccessible with fixed small-scale dissipation (fixed
resolution) because geostrophic straining creates ever-finer scales of the wave
field. \textcolor{cesar}{(I'm running a simulation with double resolution to
estimate how much energy transfer is curtailed by the strong dissipation in
this simulation.)}

The initial strong negative wave-vorticity correlation, caused by refraction, is equal
in all case. But the reduction of this negative correlation, and eventual sign change,
occurs faster with decreasing dispersivity. This is because, after the initial
eddy-scale gradients are created, weakly dispersive
waves extract much energy from the geostrophic flow via advective conversion,
$\Gamma_a$ (Figure \ref{stats_turb_various}d). The
moderate to strong dispersion solutions,  $\hslash> 1$ experience much slower
decrease of correlation, and remains negative even after $t\times U_e k_e = 150$.

\section{Discussion}
Points to emphasize and discuss:\\


\begin{itemize}
  \item The wave potential energy equation clarifies the physics of stimulated
        imbalance. But it conceals the role of linear dispersion, which is responsible
        for eventually halting the energy conversion by moving the waves out of
        straining regions---even at $\hslash=0.25$, there is no true cascade of
        wave kinetic energy density $\half |\phi|^2$. (Perhaps remark that the
        analytical solution for the elongation flow, $\psi=-\alpha x y$, is too
        idealize because of the strong assumption of \textit{uniform} rate of
        strain---regardless of the dispersivity, the waves always experience the
        same straining.)
  \item The energy transfer is significant in all examples considered (5-50$\%$
        of initial geostrophic kinetic energy). While our examples are too idealized,
        this is somewhat suggestive that stimulated generation associated with lateral
        strain and vertical vorticity may be relevant to closing the oceanic energy
        budget. There's an important limitation to our figures, which were diagnosed
        from initial value problems.
  \item Geostrophic straining accounts for the bulk energy conversion but refraction
        is fundamental to this problem with initially large-scale waves. (Perhaps
        conjecture that, in general, lateral straining may be the most important mechanism
        of energy extraction away from sharp baroclinic fronts where vertical straining
        may dominate \citep{shakespeare_hogg2017}.)
  \item The positive wave-vorticity correlation at large time is a striking result.
        Compared to previous studies
        there are two ingredients to the loss of negative correlation, and eventual
        creation of positive correlation: the unsteadiness of the geostrophic flow
        plus the wave feedback. Unsteadiness partially explains the loss of negative
        wave-vorticity correlation and its strong dependence, as conjectured by \cite{danioux_etal2015}.
        The coupling of waves and quasi-geostrophic flow accounts for the creation of
        positive wave-vorticity correlations, particularly when there's vigorous
        energy transfer (moderate to weak dispersion): refraction initially focus the waves
        into anticyclones where most of the initial energy extraction occurs.
        (Perhaps remark that stimulated imbalance could contribute to
        the vorticity skewness observed in the upper ocean.)
  \item Besides energy transfer form geostrophic flow to waves, the coupling induces
        more direct dissipation of geostrophic kinetic energy (compared with waveless
        solutions). This is because in the weak dispersion limit, the fine vorticity
        structures are removed by small-scale diffusion, which is a limitation of
        finite resolution. But small-scale diffusion could also be interpreted as
        a poor-scientist's parameterization for ageostrophic submesoscale flows,
        thus making an oblique connection with \cite{barkan_etal2016}.
  \item The decay of a laterally coherent near-inertial oscillation due to refraction by
        geostrophic flow is relevant for mixed-layer slab models used to estimate the work
        imparted by wind into the near-inertial wave field \citep[e.g., ][]{alford2001}.
        These models solve for the coherent velocity $\la\phi\ra$ and parameterize
        the loss of coherence, $\Pi$, with linear friction, $-r |\la\phi\ra|^2$.
        Our results suggest that this parameterization is inaccurate. (Of course, one
        should properly test this in equilibrated forced-dissipative solutions.)
\end{itemize}

% Both examples suggest that the advective conversion accounts for the bulk of geostrophic

% to this problem with initially laterally coherent wave because it creates the
% initial gradients of wave velocity that are then enhanced by geostrophic straining.

\section{Details of the QG-NIW model}

\subsection{The \cite{xie_vanneste2015} model}
\cite{xie_vanneste2015} derive the QG-NIW model using a variational formulation
of the generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) framework with Whitham averaging.
Following \cite{young_benjelloul1997}, Xie \& Vanneste write the
NIW velocity in complex form
\beq
u_w + \ii v_w = M_z \ee^{-\ii f_0 t}\per
\eeq
Their derivation recovers the wave equation that governs the
evolution of the NIW complex amplitude $\chi = \ii M/f_0$,
\beq
\chi_{zzt} + \p_z \sJ(\psi,\chi_{z}) + \tfrac{\ii}{2}\left[\left(\frac{N^2}{f_0}+\psi_{zz}
\right)\lap \chi - 2 \nabla\psi_z\cdot\nabla \chi_z + \chi_{zz}(\lap\psi + 2 \beta y) \right] = 0 \com
\eeq
with the QG streamfunction $\psi(x,y,z,t)$. The QG flow evolves through stirring of QGPV
\beq
q_t + \sJ(\psi,q) = 0\per
\eeq
A fundamental difference to \cite{young_benjelloul1997} is that the potential vorticity in the
\cite{xie_vanneste2015} model contains quadratic wave terms
\beq
q = \nabla \psi + \left(\tfrac{f_0^2}{N^2}\psi_z\right)_z + \beta y +
    \tfrac{\ii}{2 f_0}\sJ(\chi_z^\star,\chi_z) + \tfrac{1}{4f_0}\left(
    2 |\nabla \chi_z|^2 - \chi_{zz}^\star\nabla \chi - \chi_{zz}\nabla \chi^\star\right)\com
\eeq
thus NIWs affect the QG flow.
The model of \cite{xie_vanneste2015}, with the potential vorticity that includes
wave terms, generalizes early ideas introduced by
 \cite{buhler_mcintyre1998}  to a setup that avoids spatial scale separation between
 geostrophic flow and waves, but restricts attention to near-inertial frequencies.
Using standard perturbation theory, \cite{wagner_young2016}
recovered and extended this coupled QG-NIW system.

The special family of solutions with barotropic, f-plane QG flow, uniform background
stratification, and single vertical mode NIW, $M_z = \ee^{\ii m z}\,\phi(x,y)$,
yields the reduced set of equations \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves} used
in this paper.


% To gain further insight into the dynamics, we decompose the balanced flow
% into `vorticity-induced' and `wave-induced' fields, $\psi = \psiq + \psiw$, where
% \beq

% \eeq
% From \eqref{q_qw}, the `wave-induced' streamfunction $\psiw$ is quadratic in $\phi$:
% \beq
% \label{psiw}
% \psiw = \tfrac{1}{4f_0}|\phi|^2 + \tfrac{\ii}{2f_0}\lap^{-1}\sJ(\phis,\phi)\com
% \eeq
% where $\lap^{-1}$ is the inverse of the Laplacian: $\lap^{-1}\lap f = f $.
%
% Together, equations \eqref{waves2}-\eqref{psiw} show the non-linear
% nature of the wave equation in this coupled QG-NIW model. In particular, the
% non-linear wave dynamics is cubic in wave amplitude.  Dropping these cubic
% wave terms yields a quasi-linear (QL) QG-NIW system. This
% QL system conserves the energy
% \beq
% E_{ql} \defn \la\half|\grad\psi^q|^2\ra + \la\grad\psi^q\cdot\grad\psi^w\ra +
%           \la\tfrac{\lambda^2}{4}|\grad\phi|^2\ra\per
% \eeq
% Note that   E = $E_{ql} + \la\half|\grad\psi^w|^2\ra$. Thus, the QL approximation
% is an intermediate model between the uncoupled QG-YBJ model ($\psi^w=0$)
% and the non-linear coupled QG-NIW model.




\section{Details of the initial value problems}

\subsection{Small-scale dissipation}
To absorb the forward cascade of enstrophy, we add a biharmonic diffusivity to the
potential vorticity equation \eqref{macroturb}
\beq
D_q = -\kappa_e \lap^2 q\com
\eeq
where $\lap^2 = (\p_x^2+\p_y^2)^2$.
Similarly, to prevent the development of very small scales, which may violate the
near-inertial approximation, we add a biharmonic viscosity in the wave equation
\eqref{waves}
\beq
D_\phi = -\nu_w \lap^2 \phi\per
\eeq

The hyperviscous terms add small dissipation to the energy equations in
Section 2. The wave kinetic energy dissipation added to \eqref{action} is
\beq
\label{ep_phi}
\varepsilon_\phi \defn -\nu_w\la|\lap\phi|^2\ra\per
\eeq
The kinetic energy dissipation \eqref{ep_phi} is associated only with the incoherent
wave field, $\phi'$, since $\lap\la\phi\ra = 0$. Hyperviscosity also dissipates
wave potential energy: the dissipation added to \eqref{Pw} is
\beq
\label{chi_phi}
\chi_\phi \defn -\nu_w\tfrac{\lambda^2}{2}\la |\grad \lap\phi|^2 \ra \per
\eeq
Similarly, the geostrophic kinetic energy dissipation added to \eqref{Ke} is
\beq
\label{ep_q}
\varepsilon_q \defn \kappa_e \la \psi \lap q\ra = \kappa_e \la q \lap^2\psi\ra \com
\eeq
and the dissipation added to the potential enstrophy equation is
\beq
\label{chi_q}
\chi_q \defn -\kappa_e \la (\lap q)^2 \ra\per
\eeq
Wave dissipation also adds two extra terms to the geostrophic kinetic energy budget:
\beq
\label{xi}
\Xi = \underbrace{\tfrac{\nu_w}{2 f_0}\left\la \lap\psi \half \left(\phis \lap^2\phi + \phi
\lap^2 \phis \right) \right\ra}_{\Xi_r} +
\underbrace{\tfrac{\nu_w}{f_0}\left\la \tfrac{\ii}{2}\psi\left[\sJ(\phis,\lap^2\phi)-
\sJ(\phi,\lap^2\phis)\right]\right\ra}_{\Xi_a}\per
\eeq
The term $\Xi_r$ is easy to interpret: dissipation of wave kinetic energy,
$ \phis \lap^2\phi + \phi \lap^2\phis< 0$, in anticyclones, $\lap\psi <0 $, represents
a gain of geostrophic kinetic energy; this term is positive in all solutions of this paper.
The second term, $\Xi_a$, is obscure, but it is also positive in all solutions.
Hence, wave dissipation yields a gain of geostrophic kinetic energy.

In all solutions of initial value problems reported in this paper, the dissipative
terms \eqref{ep_phi}, \eqref{chi_phi}, \eqref{ep_q}, and \eqref{xi} account for
less than $10\%$ of the energy tendencies. The energy budgets
close within $10^{-5}\,\%$.

\subsection{Numerical methods}
We solve the QG-NIW system \eqref{macroturb}-\eqref{waves} using a standard
collocation Fourier spectral method.
In the pseudo-spectral spirit, we evaluate  the quadratic non-linearities in
physical space, and transform the product into Fourier space. We time march the
spectral equations
using an exponential time differencing method with a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme
\citep[details in][]{kassam_trefethen2005}.
